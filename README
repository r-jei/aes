My very own implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). (Do not use for production! It's vulnerable to side-channel attacks)

To test this implementation:

$ make
$ ./tests

By default, the tests for 128, 192 and 256 bit encryption/decryption are run.
Uncomment other tests in tests.c and recompile to use the other tests.
Pass a '-v' flag to enable verbose output.
